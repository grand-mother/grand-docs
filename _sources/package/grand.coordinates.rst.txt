Extension of :mod:`astropy.coordinates`
=======================================
.. module:: grand.tool.coordinates

----

Overview
--------

The :mod:`grand` package extends :mod:`astropy.coordinates` with geographic
representations and local frames. It adds the :class:`~grand.ECEF` and
:class:`~grand.LTP` frames as well as the
:class:`~grand.GeodeticRepresentation` and
:class:`~grand.HorizontalRepresentation` of coordinates.


Frames
------

The :mod:`grand` frames differ from base :mod:`astropy.coordinates` frames in
several respects. First, they all inherit from a
:class:`~grand.ExtendedCoordinateFrame` instead of a
:mod:`~astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`. Their coordinates data are
*read only*. This prevents some severe bugs (e.g. see issue `#9873`_). In
addition, they support basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-` and `*`).

Secondly, the :mod:`grand` frames are co-moving with the Earth. i.e. the
*obstime* can be omitted, in which case it is inherited from the source frame
during transforms. This differs from base :mod:`astropy.coordinates` frames
where the observation time must be stated explicitly during a transform (E.g.
see issue `#8390`_).

If specified, the observation time must be an instance of an `astropy`
:class:`~astropy.time.Time` object or any of its initializers, E.g.
:class:`~datetime.datetime`, or `str`.

In addition, the frame classes defined in :mod:`astropy.coordinates` do not
distinguish points from vectors when transforming between frames. The `grand`
frames do. An automatic type inference occurs based on the data
:mod:`astropy.units`, as following.

.. warning::
   If the frame data are homogeneous to a length, there are assumed to
   transform as a point. Otherwise, they transform as a vector quantity.


ECEF frame
^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~grand.ECEF` class (`Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed`_) is a wrapper for
geocentric frames. It behaves as the :class:`~astropy.coordinates.ITRS` frame
but co-moving with the Earth, i.e. the *obstime* can be omitted.


.. autoclass:: grand.ECEF

   .. note::
      By default, a :class:`~astropy.coordinates.CartesianRepresentation` is
      expected for the coordinates data, i.e. *x*, *y* and *z*. For example,
      the following represents a point located at the origin.

   >>> origin = ECEF(x = 0 * u.m, y = 0 * u.m, z = 0 * u.m)

   .. autoproperty:: grand.ECEF.earth_location
   .. autoproperty:: grand.ECEF.obstime


LTP frame
^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~grand.LTP` class (`Local Tangent Plane coordinates`_) allows to
define local frames tangent to the WGS84 ellipsoid. The *orientation* property
can be used to define the frame axes, along the directions of the local magnetic
field. E.g. the following defines a local magnetic North, East, Down (NED) frame
centered on Greenwich, as:

>>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation
>>> ltp = LTP(location=EarthLocation.of_site('greenwich'),
...           orientation='NED')

By default magnetic North, West, Up (NWU) coordinates are used. If not
explicitly specified the magnetic *declination* is computed using the built-in
:mod:`~grand.geomagnet` module. Alternatively, geographic coordinates can be
used as well by setting *magnetic* to `False`.

.. note::
   One must always specify the local frame origin, as the *location* parameter.

.. autoclass:: grand.LTP

   .. note::
      By default, a :class:`~astropy.coordinates.CartesianRepresentation` is
      expected for the coordinates data, i.e. *x*, *y* and *z*.

   .. automethod:: grand.LTP.rotated

   .. autoproperty:: grand.LTP.earth_location
   .. autoproperty:: grand.LTP.magnetic
   .. autoproperty:: grand.LTP.orientation
   .. autoproperty:: grand.LTP.obstime


Extended frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~grand.ExtendedCoordinateFrame` is an extension of the astropy
:class:`~astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame` but with *read only* data.
This prevents some type of severe bugs that could occur with astropy frames
when data are modified in-place (E.g. see issue `#9873`_).

Furthermore the :class:`~grand.ExtendedCoordinateFrame` also implements the
addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`) and multiplication (`*`) arithmetic operators.
Those are forwarded to the frame coordinates.

.. note::

   When adding or subtracting two frames the resulting system is the one of the
   left hand side.  If needed, the coordinates of the right hand side are
   transformed to the system of the left hand side before being added or
   subtracted.  Consequently, the addition of two frames is not strictly
   commutative. Note that one can also add or subtract a frame with a
   :class:`~astropy.coordinates.BaseRepresentation` in which case the
   representation is assumed to be in the frame system.

.. autoclass:: grand.ExtendedCoordinateFrame

   This class inherits from a :class:`~astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`.
   Most functionalities are identical and are not documented here.

   .. warning::

      The `data` managed by the frame and by any of its representations are
      enforced to be *read only* in order to prevent in-place modifications.
      However, contrary to a :class:`astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`
      it is allowed to (re)set the data to another representation, e.g. as:

      ..
         >>> frame = ECEF(0, 0, 0)

      >>> frame.data = CartesianRepresentation(0, 0, 0)


Representations
---------------

The :mod:`grand` package explictly adds two geographic representations based on
the WGS84 ellipsoid. Note that although `astropy` uses the corresponding
transforms it does not explictly bundle them as coordinates representations.

Geodetic coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :class:`~grand.GeodeticRepresentation` is analog to a
:class:`~astropy.coordinates.SphericalRepresentation` but mapping to the WGS84
ellipsoid instead of a sphere. It allows to represent :mod:`~grand.ECEF`
coordinates using a `geodetic datum`_ instead of the default
:mod:`astropy.coordinates.Cartesian`, E.g. as:

>>> point = ECEF(latitude=45 * u.deg, longitude=3 * u.deg, height=0.5 * u.m,
...              representation_type='geodetic')

.. autoclass:: grand.GeodeticRepresentation

   .. note::
      The *latitude* angle is measured clockwise, w.r.t. the xOy plane. The
      *longitude* angle is measured counter-clockwise, w.r.t. the x-axis. The
      *height* is w.r.t. the WGS84 ellipsoid. It defaults to `0` meters if
      ommitted.

   .. automethod:: grand.GeodeticRepresentation.from_cartesian
   .. automethod:: grand.GeodeticRepresentation.to_cartesian


Horizontal coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~grand.HorizontalRepresentation` allows to represent a unit vector,
e.g. a direction, in a local :class:`~grand.LTP` frame using a `horizontal
coordinates system`_. For example, the following defines a unit vector pointing
upwards at Greenwich:

>>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation
>>> up = LTP(location=EarthLocation.of_site('greenwich'),
...          representation_type='horizontal',
...          azimuth = 0 * u.deg, elevation = 90 * u.deg)

.. autoclass:: grand.HorizontalRepresentation

   .. note::
      The *azimuth* angle is measured clockwise, w.r.t. the y axis. The
      *elevation* angle is measured clockwise, w.r.t. the xOy plane.

   .. automethod:: grand.HorizontalRepresentation.from_cartesian

      .. warning::
         The Cartesian unit vector **must** be dimensioneless. Though it is not
         checked if the norm of the vector is indeed unity.

   .. automethod:: grand.HorizontalRepresentation.to_cartesian
